# C - Binary trees

In this project we are going to see binary trees structure, how to manipulate and modify
them.

## Helper File :raised_hands: :checkered_flag:

* [binary_tree_print.c](./binary_tree_print.c): C function that prints binary
trees.

## Header File :file_folder: :open_file_folder:

* [binary_trees.h](./binary_trees.h): Header file containing definitions and
prototypes.

Data Structures
```
struct binary_tree_s
{
    int n;
    struct binary_tree_s *parent;
    struct binary_tree_s *left;
    struct binary_tree_s *right;
};

typedef struct binary_tree_s binary_tree_t;
typedef struct binary_tree_s bst_t;
typedef struct binary_tree_s avl_t;
